1.  Go to the free download location on RStudio’s website: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>

2.  The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:

If not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.

3.  Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).
